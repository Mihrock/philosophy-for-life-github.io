The study of Philosophy can help people live more meaningful lives with increased happiness and life satisfaction. This website is an effort to provide an increased sense of wellbeing to the users through theoretical Philosophy and practice of various types of Meditation. The website also provides discussion forums for people to share their own ideas about subjects of politics, ethics, society, mental health and general wellbeing.</p></div></div></div><div class="segregate"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-down fa-3x" style="color:#5a7fac" aria-hidden="true"></i></div><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-10 offset-1 text"><h2>Four Reasons Why Philosophy Is As Relevant As Ever</h2><br><h3>1. Philosophy is the foundation of critical thinking.</h3><p>While society is very different today from when the founding figures of Western philosophy were making their mark, the questions we face today are just as challenging. Enter modern philosophy, which puts critical thinking and problem-solving at the forefront in order to make sense of these weighty problems.</p><h3>2. Science can’t answer every question.</h3><p>At its core, philosophy is a striving towards figuring out what is true and worthwhile, and what it means to live a meaningful and worthwhile life. That’s something off-limits for science, because science can tell us how things are empirically, but it can’t prescribe how we should then live.<br>In short: science helps us live longer, whereas philosophy helps us live better.</p><h3>3. Philosophy has particular meaning in the business world.</h3><p>that anyone who wants to succeed in a challenging, leading position in business, public administration, politics, or the wider society needs a crucial set of skills. You will need to see quickly through complex issues, put together convincing arguments for or against given proposals, filter relevant from irrelevant information, check the consistency and soundness of policy papers, decide which problems are crucial and identify the issues that are still badly understood. These skills of rigorous analysis, sound argument and critical examination are the bread-and-butter of philosophy: no subject trains our ability for consistent, systematic thought better than philosophy.</p><h3>4. Ancient philosophers continue to influence humanity.</h3><p>The ancient Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle may seem like the quintessential Dead White Males, but in fact they are very much alive. Twenty four centuries ago they laid the foundations of Western culture, and their ideas and insights still dictate essential features of our world right now, from what we eat to what we see on the internet. And while you may think of Confucius purely in terms of sound bites, his work was extremely significant -- and remains so today. This is very useful to know, especially for students in fields such as political science, diplomacy and international politics.</p></div></div></div><div class="segregate"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-down fa-3x" style="color:#5a7fac" aria-hidden="true"></i></div><div class="container text"><div class="row"><div class="col-12 col-md-10 float-md-left"><h4>I wish that one day the education systems of the world incorporate the study of Philosophy since a very young age for students and teach them how to be happy.
